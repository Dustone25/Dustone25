API versioning and changelog
As a reminder, there's the context.api array in every API response which contains the following data:

context.api.version — version of API
context.api.last_major_update — timestamp of the last update, that somehow has broken backward compatibility for "stable" endpoints
context.api.next_major_update — timestamp of the next scheduled update, that can break compatibility, or null, if there are no updates scheduled
context.api.documentation — an URL to the latest version of documentation
context.api.notice — just a text notice which, for example, may describe upcoming changes (this is an optional field)
When we change something, or add new functions, we bump the API version number. Generally, we try as hard as possible not to bring any compatibility-breaking changes in API updates, but sometimes this is needed as some blockchains change their features themselves, we're fixing various bugs, etc. This doesn't apply, however, to changes to endpoints which are either marked as alpha- or beta-stage functions, or unstable in nature (e.g. all raw endpoints where the API returns data directly from our nodes, and the response may change as we upgrade the nodes). These marks are reflected in the Quick endpoint reference.

The changelog is available here: https://github.com/Blockchair/Blockchair.Support/blob/master/API.md

It makes sense to check if context.api.version has increased and/or just whether context.api.next_major_update is not null or larger than the latest update date known to you. If that's the case — you can send yourself a notification and review the changelog to make your application compatible with the changes starting from context.api.next_major_update.

General stats endpoints
Stats on multiple blockchains at once
Allows to retrieve the most important stats on all blockchains we support via just one API request.

Endpoint:

https://api.blockchair.com/stats
If you require data on just one blockchain, please use https://api.blockchair.com/{:chain}/stats instead.

Output:

data contains an array with stats on 15 blockchains we support at once:

Bitcoin
Bitcoin Cash
Ethereum
Litecoin
Bitcoin SV
Dogecoin
Dash
Ripple
Groestlcoin
Stellar
Monero
Cardano
Zcash
Mixin
Tezos
eCash
and on 3 cross-chain tokens:

Tether (USDT)
USD Coin (USDC)
Binance USD (BUSD)
Note that Bitcoin Testnet stats are not included in this output.

Description of the fields is available in the next three sections of documentation.

Output:

data contains an array with blockchain statistics:

blocks — total number of blocks (note that it's 1 more than the latest block number as there is block #0)
transactions — total number of transactions
outputs — total number of outputs (including spent)
circulation — number of coins in circulation (in satoshi)
blockchain_size — total size of all blocks in bytes (note: it's not the size of a full node, it's just bare blocks; nodes are bigger in size as they use database indexing, etc)
nodes— number of full network nodes (it's an approximate number and actually not a blockchain metric)
difficulty — current mining difficulty
hashrate_24h — approximated hashrate over the last 24 hours (returned as a string as it doesn't fit into an integer)
